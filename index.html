        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
        Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
        Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
        Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
        local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13]
        His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
        Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the
        youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His
        ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
        numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
        ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
        from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
        trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
        Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
        With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however,
        the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
        the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was
        poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to
        sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21] In
        his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright
        and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours
        on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his
        education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam
        went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where
        he graduated in Physics in 1954.[22] Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to
        study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While
        Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied
        with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship
        unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met
        the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting
        you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."[23] He
        narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he
        placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in
        the IAF.[24]

        On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on
        "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management
        Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
        discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[86]
        At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he
        collapsed.[87][88] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a
        critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs
        of life.[87] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was
        confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.[87][89][90]
        His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny
        guy! Are you doing well?"[91] Following his death, Kalam's body was
        airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati,
        from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air
        force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that
        afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the
        Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three
        service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's
        body.[92] His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the
        Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there,
        the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime
        minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and
        Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh
        Yadav.[93] On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the
        Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air
        force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His
        body was received at the airport by the three service chiefs and
        national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar
        Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil
        Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief
        ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of
        Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of
        Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an
        open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public to pay
        their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.[94][95] On 30 July 2015,
        the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground
        with full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites,
        including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief
        ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.[
